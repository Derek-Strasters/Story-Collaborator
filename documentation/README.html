Codename Scuba-Noodle</font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Concept</h1>
<h2 class="western">Main Functions</h2>
<p>Codename Scuba Noodle will be a web interface for users to
collaborate on a story a few paragraphs at a time.  Each user will be
able to create a new story with a short description of the premise. 
That description is posted to a public listing that orders them on
popularity and newness.  Users may enter a blurb of up to a
predefined amount of letters that they think would be a good writing
for the story, and they may also enter blurbs to follow preceding
blurbs.  Users may also rate each blurb, which is handled by a voting
system, the exact score or each blurb is hidden from users.  Blurbs
with similar ratings are placed near each-other, with high ratings
near the top, but with some randomization that slightly changes the
ordering for each user to prevent biasing.  After a predetermined
amount of time, voting to finish a story is opened, there will be a
balanced method of determining how many positive and negative votes
will be required to keep a story alive or lock it as finished.  The
user will be able to view stories that are in progress as a
concatenation of all connected blurbs, they may choose an alternate
blurb at any point which changes all children blurbs past that point,
but the highest rated blurb chain will be viewable with a hot-link
“show most popular storyline”.</p>
<p>Ancillary Functions</p>
<p>There will be the ability to make short comments in a tiered
system that display in a separate pane for each blurb, limited in
length by a small predetermined amount.  Users can log in to preserve
their blurb history, as well as comments, and their popularity
rating.</p>
<h1 class="western">Features</h1>
<h2 class="western">Supported Devices</h2>
<p>The project will contain an API such that access to content may be
extended by developers to any platform with Internet access.</p>
<p>Browser support for the main web-page at paracite.org will
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>Chrome</p>
	<li/>
<p>Firefox</p>
	<li/>
<p>Internet Explorer (Latest version only)</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Minimum System Requirements</h2>
<p>Web-page must not exceed memory use above 350MB.  
</p>
<p>Page must animate better than 20fps on hardware of <font color="#ff3333">&lt;to
be determined&gt;</font>.</p>
<h2 class="western">User Accounts</h2>
<p>Accounts may be verified by Facebook API</p>
<p>Account passwords and other credentials must be stored as their
salted hashed values</p>
<p>Accounts must store post history, comment history, and score</p>
<p>Accounts can be set as administrative</p>
<h2 class="western">Posting</h2>
<p>Users have the ability to create a new story thread</p>
<p>Users can post blurbs on threads</p>
<p>Users can vote on blurbs</p>
<p>Users can comment on blurbs in a tier system, meaning they can
comment on comments (like Reddit.com).</p>
<p>Users can vote a story as finished.</p>
<h2 class="western">Ordering and Sorting</h2>
<p>Blurbs are to be sorted based on a mathematical function of
newness, voting score, and a randomization factor.  High scores will
outweigh both newness and randomization over time.</p>
<p>Actual scores are kept hidden, but a qualitative indicator (akin
to color or a progress bar) is presented to the user to show how
“good” a blurb is.</p>
<h2 class="western">GUI</h2>
<h3 class="western">View From a Thread</h3>
<p><font color="#000000">From the thread interface, there is a list
of blurbs stacked oldest on top newest on bottom within a scrolling
box that takes up the largest portion of the screen.  There is an
obviously placed link to go to the latest portion of the story.  If a
story becomes larger than an amount <font color="#ff3333">&lt;to be
determined&gt;</font> of lines then an area will become available as
a side bar on the left that allows for navigating pages similar to a
PDF reader.  Each blurb may be selected, upon selecting a blurb a
side bar on the right populates with alternate blurbs for the user to
select among other blurbs for that branching point in the story.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Each blurb will have the following displayed
near the top of it's container: a rating indicator, the author.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Each blurb will have the following displayed
near the bottom of it's container: voting controls, a report button,
and a comment button.</font></p>
<h3 class="western"><font color="#000000">View From the Comments</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">When the comment button is pressed a new
floating window is created with the comments for that blurb, clicking
a new blurb comment button while this window is still open will
repopulate this window with the new comments.</font></p>
<h3 class="western"><font color="#000000">Main view</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">A list of threads</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">A place to login or sign up</font></p>
